# Face Recognition System (Matlab)

This repository contains a face recognition system implemented in Matlab. The system can detect and identify faces in images or real-time video streams using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms.

#Features

Face detection: The system can locate and extract faces from input images or video frames.
Face recognition: It can compare the extracted faces with a pre-defined set of known faces and determine if there is a match.
Real-time processing: The system can perform face recognition in real-time, making it suitable for applications such as surveillance, access control, or attendance tracking.
Accuracy: The system employs advanced machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in face recognition tasks.
Scalability: It can handle a large number of faces in the database and perform efficient searching and matching.

#Dependencies

Matlab (R2019b or later)
Computer Vision Toolbox: For image and video processing.
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox: For machine learning algorithms.

#Usage

Prepare the face database: Create a database of known faces by collecting images of each person you want to recognize. Organize the images in separate directories, with each directory representing a different person. The more images you have per person, the better the system's accuracy.

Train the face recognition model: Use the train.m script to train the face recognition model. This script will analyze the images in the face database, extract facial features, and train a machine learning model. The trained model will be saved for future use.


#Notes

The accuracy of the face recognition system depends on the quality of the input images, the diversity of the face database, and the training duration.
It is recommended to use high-resolution images and consistent lighting conditions for better results.
